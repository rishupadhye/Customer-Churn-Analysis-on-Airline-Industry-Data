# Customer-Churn-Analysis-on-Airline-Industry-Data
Southeast Airlines needed to lower their customer churn, to lower the same the airlines tried to have a robust loyalty program for the frequent flyers. The customers could bank their points and use it for their next flight with the airlines. However, the customers were valuing the program less, so this is the reason why the airline does not want to rely on this program to keep the customer churn less.    The real goal is to reduce the churn by getting ahead of loss of customers by identifying some indicators or metrics that will help us identify when a customer was about to stop flying in the Southeast Airlines. We have a dataset of customers who the airlines had recently surveyed. Using the 32 characteristics of the data we provided some business solutions which will help the airlines to lower the customer churn and will help to select the regional airlines the company has to do business in future.
